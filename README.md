This is a small porfolio dem from over 2 years ago which demonstarted proficiency in laravel, react, and various other languages. This is a very old project and not an accurate demonstration of my current skill set and knowledge. 

Steps to view:
1. git clone 
2. composer update
2. php artisan key:generate
3. cp .env.example .env
4. modify the .env with your local db details
5. php artisan jwt:secret
6. php artisan serve

I am happy to take techncial test for demonstarte current skill level.
